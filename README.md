## 💡 Overview

This project uses Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon). 
If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where Pokémon creatures battle against each other. 
Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. 
In this project we’ll make several classes that interact with each other so you can create your own Pokémon battles!
